# Real Estate Price Prediction - Machine Learning Model
This project demonstrates a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features of real estate properties. The model uses the Boston Housing Dataset (or a similar dataset) and applies a variety of machine learning techniques to predict the median value of houses in a specific area, represented by the target variable MEDV.

## Key Features of the Project:
* **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
Data is loaded, explored, and cleaned to handle missing values and outliers.
Feature engineering is performed, including the creation of new attributes such as TAXRM (tax rate per room).
Data normalization and standardization techniques are applied to scale numerical features.

* **Model Selection:**
Various models are explored, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
Random Forest Regressor is selected as the final model due to its higher accuracy and robustness.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
GridSearchCV is used to perform hyperparameter optimization on the Random Forest Regressor, testing different combinations of hyperparameters like n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, and max_features.

* **Model Evaluation:**
The performance of the model is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Cross-validation (with 5 folds) is used to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

* **Model Deployment:**
The final trained model is saved using joblib for later use in prediction tasks.

## Key Steps:
* **Data Exploration and Cleaning** – Includes handling missing values and outliers.
* **Feature Engineering** – Creation of meaningful new features.
* **Model Selection and Training** – Evaluation of multiple models and selection of the best.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimization of the Random Forest model.
* **Evaluation and Cross-Validation** – Model performance analysis using RMSE and cross-validation.
* **Deployment** – Saving the model using joblib for future predictions.

## Technologies Used:

## Future Work:
* Experiment with other machine learning models like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting for potentially better performance.
* Implement feature selection to reduce dimensionality and improve model interpretability.
* Extend the project by incorporating additional features (e.g., location, proximity to amenities).
